So Plan is changed : Algorithm is now written ! 

Structure for the program : :

We need a admin mode as well as a user mode 
OR else we could enter questions ourselevs in the code and just display the answers but that would be complicated. 
We can also make a data base and make a forms for inputting the question.

So firstly we need a admin class 
we also need a main class
and a runner class

Admin Class : 
Admin powers which let them enter option and questions as well
